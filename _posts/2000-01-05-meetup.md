### Microservices Meetup Munich

In March 2014 we did some workshops at AutoScout24 to define our architecture strategy. Inspired by Netflix and as an evolution of our previous approaches, we wanted to further modularize our monolith into smaller services. While refining our ideas, Martin Fowler and James Lewis published their definition of the term on [Microservices on Martin Fowler's blog](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html).

That helped a lot because our vision was suddenly an architectural style with a name. But there was still a lot to learn, so I founded the [Microservices Meetup Munich](http://www.meetup.com/Microservices-Meetup-Munich/) in May 2014 with AutoScout24 as sponsor. Since then, we were lucky to have a lot of thought leaders in the Microservices community and a nice round of local speakers. Including [James Lewis](https://www.meetup.com/Microservices-Meetup-Munich/events/218909112/) mentioned above ;-).

The meetup has now more than 2200 members and we can look back at 35 events.

Most of the talks are availabe at our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeh0x77J4sv2E1IFMzAEiBw)
