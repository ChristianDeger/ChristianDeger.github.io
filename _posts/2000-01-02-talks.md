### Abstracts

#### How To Platform ####
Since 2016, RIO has been working on digitalizing the supply chain of its customers with a growing product portfolio. RIO is able to provide telematics and transport management solutions as well as driver communication for carriers from a single source – regardless of the manufacturer of your vehicles. In addition, RIO is a strong partner for shippers and provides a platform for suppliers, transport service providers, and industrial companies.

"We provide an opinionated self-service platform, that enables You - the product delivery teams at RIO, MAN, and LATAM - to build, operate, and maintain compliant and secure services without hazzle."
This is the platform vision of RIO.

The RIO platform comes in two flavors, a tech platform, and a business platform. Both support the service teams and help them to focus on creating high-quality products. The platform provides services to reduce the complexity of managing the infrastructure. It simplifies the connection to the trucks and busses or provides a marketplace to monetarize the products.

In our talk, we will share our experiences in developing this platform. We will reason why RIO decided to implement this strategy. We explain how we shape our platform services and describe the principles behind our architecture.

Another part looks at the organization and the teams building the platform. We will show you how we collaborate and shared knowledge within the teams to develop a successful platform.

#### Building A Cloud-Native Advanced Logistics Ecosystem
RIO is the digital brand of the TRATON GROUP. Its dual offer of a group-wide connectivity environment and a cloud based advanced logistics ecosystem is geared towards all players in the transport industry. RIO moves to the forefront in a nascent market for real-time cloud visibility and uses the cloud to connect customers and partners in dozens of countries across the globe.
Learn how RIO leverages AWS and microservices to enable autonomous you build it, you run it teams to quickly create scalable applications, real-time streaming pipelines and data products. This talk continues to outline how RIO combines Kafka, MongoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon ECS as well as AWS Fargate to tackle use cases like performance scoring, vehicle diagnostics, or fleet monitoring.

#### Cloud Native Continuous Delivery
You know that adopting Continuous Delivery and DevOps is key to a high-performance company. You’ve read the books and are ready to build microservices in the cloud. Great! Let’s go back to the principles and see how to apply them in a cloud native environment. What used to about shipping code to static servers, is now about quickly creating decoupled pipelines for new services that are readily wired up into the platform and everything is driven by code.

This talk will give concrete guidance in a world where autonomous teams continuously deploy many independent services and containers into an infrastructure that is dynamically created via APIs. Learn how to establish a culture that fosters fast local decisions and is driven by fast feedback. Remove friction by removing the staging environment and still release with confidence.

Listen to stories from the trenches on true DevOps on AWS with “You build it, you run it” teams from AutoScout24, the largest online car marketplace Europe-wide.

#### Enterprise Fast Lane - Transforming to Microservices in the Cloud
Learn how AutoScout24, the largest online car marketplace Europe-wide, are building their Autobahn in the cloud.

The secret ingredient? Culture! Because “microservices and cloud” is only one half of the digital transformation story: The other half is how your organization deals with cultural change as you transition from the old world of IT into building microservices on AWS with agile DevOps teams in a true “you build it, you run it” fashion.

Listen to stories from the trenches and learn how to become cloud-native, evolve your architecture step by step, drive cultural change across your teams, and manage your company’s transformation for the future.

#### Data Science, Delivered Continuously
AutoScout24 is the largest online car marketplace Europe-wide for new and used cars. With more than 2.4 million listings across Europe, AutoScout24 has access to large amounts of data about historic and current market prices and wants to use this data to empower its users to make informed decisions about selling and buying cars. We created a live price estimation service for used vehicles based on a Random Forest prediction model that is continuously delivered to the end user.

Predictive analytics of such sort is often only used for guiding company internal decision making. Delivering a predictive analytics product straight to the end user poses an entirely different set of requirements with respect to (1) performance and (2) automated quality control.

In order to avoid the effort of handcrafting a high-performance implementation of a complex prediction model, many companies fall back to use primitive prediction models in such a situation. Learn how we achieved superb performance and scalability without the need for manual optimization or sacrifices in terms of prediction accuracy.

For quality control, Continuous Delivery is already an established approach to modern web application development that allows for much shorter product release cycles and therefore yields the ability to rapidly innovate and adapt to user needs. However, in predictive analytics Continuous Delivery has been rarely applied so far. Learn how automated verification using live test data sets in a continuous delivery pipeline allows us to release model improvements with confidence at any given time. This way our users can benefit immediately from the work of our data scientists.
